Hey, I’m a **French guy** who literally dropped everything even my country to try living off what inspires me, in order to inspire others in turn.  
I stand for **beauty and simplicity**, **kindness**, and an **open heart**. I’m not here to sell you anything, but to help through the energy I put into what I love.
  Honestly, I’m a beginner at a lot of things, not because I wanna master every aspect of my life, but because I especially love trying as : *Gym & mostly well-being, piano, boxing, art & fashion and more recently photography.* 

  I plan to post **again and again**, improve constantly, and share that journey with anyone who wants to follow this guy who’s doing his best to accomplish great things in life through beauty.

#### I still would like to share some tips that guide me through my day :

Don’t wait to be ready to start ; Don’t fear others’ opinions, embrace them ; When you feel bad, try imagining your future self in 1 hour, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year to see if that pain is justified ; Life is unfair, but it’s still beautiful.

Have a **wonderful day**.
