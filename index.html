  <p><em>César Golab</em></p>

    Hey, I’m a <strong>French guy</strong> who literally dropped everything—even my country—to try living off what inspires me, in order to inspire others in turn.<br>
    I stand for <strong>beauty and simplicity</strong>, <strong>kindness</strong>, and an <strong>open heart</strong>. I’m not here to sell you anything, but to help through the energy I put into what I love.<br>
    Honestly, I’m a beginner at a lot of things, not because I wanna master every aspect of my life, but because I especially love trying as : <em>Gym & mostly well-being, piano, boxing, art & fashion and more recently photography</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I plan to post <strong>again and again</strong>, improve constantly, and share that journey with anyone who wants to follow this gu
