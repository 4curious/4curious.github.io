  <p><em>César Golab</em></p>

  <p>
    Hey, I’m a <strong>French guy</strong> who literally dropped everything—even my country—to try living off what inspires me, in order to inspire others in turn.<br>
    I stand for <strong>beauty and simplicity</strong>, <strong>kindness</strong>, and an <strong>open heart</strong>. I’m not here to sell you anything, but to help through the energy I put into what I love.<br>
    Honestly, I’m a beginner at a lot of things, not because I wanna master every aspect of my life, but because I especially love trying as : <em>Gym & mostly well-being, piano, boxing, art & fashion and more recently photography</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I plan to post <strong>again and again</strong>, improve constantly, and share that journey with anyone who wants to follow this guy who’s doing his best to accomplish great things in life through beauty.
  </p>

  <p>
    I still would like to share some tips that guide me through my day :
  </p>

  <p><em>
    Don’t wait to be ready to start ; Don’t fear others’ opinions, embrace them ; When you feel bad, try imagining your future self in 1 hour, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year to see if that pain is justified ; Life is unfair, but it’s still beautiful.
  </em></p>

  <p><strong>A quote that I really enjoy</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    “We build too many walls and not enough bridges.”<br>
    — <em>Isaac Newton</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Looking forward to chatting with you, my friend.<br>
    Have a <strong>won
